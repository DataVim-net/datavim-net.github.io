# About Me
I've always been part mathemtican, part computer scientist and found my place in data science/engineering. I enjoy working in technical start-ups where I can do a variety of things and don't get stuck iterating on the same model endlessly or having to work in notebooks unless I want to.

After my first encounter with Vim almost 25 years ago, I have seen it's beauty and embraced NeoVim as my primary development tool (after years with Emacs and VS Code).
