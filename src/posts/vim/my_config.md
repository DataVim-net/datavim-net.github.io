# NeoVim Config
There are several great things about NeoVim, one is it's customizability, another is that that customizability is done in Lua. As with anything highly customizable, this can be overwhelming especially when you just need something to work. If you're new to NeoVim, or just curious about different set-ups, looking at other's configuration files can be great.

I keep mine on GitHub, mainly to easily use the same config across work and personal computers and for back-up purposes. This also makes it easy to share: [Config Repo](https://github.com/jpreszler/config)
